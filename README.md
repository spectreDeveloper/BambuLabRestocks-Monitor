# BambuLabRestocks-Monitor
Monitoring your desired bambulab products availability.

This was an old project made for fun months ago, when the BambuLab A1 was OUT-OF-STOCK, i made it to be sure to catch the availability when it comes back.
I've used it also to be notified when some PLA comeback in stock.
Project is made for European Marketplace, but can be easly adapted for US.

This was the first release, but in future if the project will be adopted from the bambulab community members, i will update and optimize it.

For any questions feel free to open an issue.
