# BambuLab Product Availability Monitor üõ†Ô∏è

This project was originally created for fun months ago when the BambuLab A1 was OUT-OF-STOCK. It ensures you catch the availability when it comes back. I've also used it to get notified when certain PLA types come back in stock. This project is tailored for the European Marketplace but can be easily adapted for the US.

This is the first release, but if the project is adopted by the BambuLab community members, I will update and optimize it in the future.
